# SystemSoftware Homework Results Repository

Please consult the [HTWG SYSLAB SYSO Introduction](https://htwg-syslab-syso.github.io/) to get started.

#### TL;DR
Do not attempt to push directly to your group repository, instead **fork this repository**.

Then **create one branch per homework**.

When one homework is done, **create a pull-request against the upstream repository** of your work.
